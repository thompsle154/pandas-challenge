In reviewing the data, the students do better in reading than in math and score higher in Charter schools over District schools

The more money spent per student does not mean higher scores, in fact the highest scores in math and reading are the students that have the lowest spending.

The school size shows the medium schools have the best math and reading scores, and have closer scores to the smaller schools than the bigger ones.
